<p>The appraisal process is an opportunity for you to reflect on your performance, set goals for the future, and receive feedback from your manager. It is also a time for the company to acknowledge your contributions and determine compensation and career advancement opportunities.</p>
<p>Below is the currrent Appraisal Cycle details:</p>

<p>We also understand that this process can be a little stressful and daunting. However, we encourage you to view it as an opportunity for growth and development. We believe that an honest and constructive appraisal discussion will help you identify areas of improvement and achieve your professional goals.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to your manager or the HR department. We wish you all the best for the upcoming appraisal cycle.</p>
